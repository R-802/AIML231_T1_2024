I have refactored the majority of the code given to us in the templates to use Plotly, an open-source graphing library for Python. I decided to do this because not only is it a graphing library I have more experience with, but because it allows us to create interactive plots which means we can explore the data in greater detail. This interactivity can be particularly beneficial when presenting complex data, as it enables users to zoom in on areas of interest, toggle data series on and off, and hover over data points to see additional details. 

I stored the datasets in a "data" folder, not the root directory, so you may or may not have to adjust the paths in order for the code to work with your setup. Some functions in the code will also try to make or check if a folder exists to save data to. This approach is aimed at organizing the data and outputs more efficiently, ensuring that the working directory remained clean and manageable. 

If you run the code, you may run into and issue with saving the plots, the latest kaleido version is the cause of this, so you will need to downgrade to kaleido v0.1.0.
